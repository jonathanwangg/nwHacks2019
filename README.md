Air quality monitor for people who do exercise in polluted air

## Purpose:
With the increasing amount of air pollution that we face, many people who exercise outdoors are at risk of inhaling excessive amounts of polluted air during strenuous exercises. We decided to create a mobile Android application to notify users to take a break from outdoor activities. We combined the data from an air quality sensor and heart rate data from the Fitbit to calculate when the user should stop exercising.

## Required Hardware:
- Fitbit
- Air Quality Sensor
- Arduino
- UV Sensor
- Phone
